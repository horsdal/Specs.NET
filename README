To try this out open the Specs.sln file in Visual Studio.
Fix the nunit reference in the Specs project.
Run the tests in LeapYearTest. The following output should be produced:

------------------------
A leap year should
	be any year divisible by 400
	but not other years divisible by 100
	and all other years divisible by 4

1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, took 2,09 seconds (NUnit 2.5.5).
-------------------------

The LeapYearTest file shows how these extension methods work. Enjoy!
